## üîç Search Capabilities

### Disease Variations Handling

The application intelligently handles multiple representations of diseases:

- **NSCLC** variants: "non small cell lung cancer", "non small cell lung carcinoma", "NSCLC", "carcinoma of the lungs, non small cell"
- **Fuzzy matching**: Partial matches with 80% threshold
- **Text normalization**: Handles punctuation, case variations, and abbreviations

### Multi-field Search

Searches across all relevant fields:

- Trial titles (brief and official)
- Descriptions and summaries
- Conditions and keywords
- Sponsor names
- Intervention names and descriptions

## üìã Required Questions Answered

### 1. How would you extend filtering by additional criteria?

**Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Add new filter types to types**: Update `SearchFilters` interface in `src/types/clinical-trials.ts`
2. **Extend filter options**: Add new filter extraction in `src/lib/data-loader.ts` `getFilterOptions()`
3. **Update filtering logic**: Extend `applyFilters()` function with new filter conditions
4. **Add UI components**: Create new filter sections in `src/components/filter-panel.tsx`
5. **Update API schema**: Add new parameters to tRPC input validation

**Example for Trial Phase sub-categories:**

```typescript
// Add to SearchFilters interface
interface SearchFilters {
  phase?: string[];
  phaseSubCategory?: string[]; // Early Phase 1, Phase 1/2, etc.
  // ... existing filters
}

// Extend filtering logic
if (filters.phaseSubCategory) {
  const hasMatchingSubPhase = trial.protocolSection.designModule?.phases?.some(
    (phase) => filters.phaseSubCategory!.includes(phase)
  );
  if (!hasMatchingSubPhase) return false;
}
```

### 2. What compromises were made and why?

**Key Compromises:**

1. **In-Memory Data Storage**

   - _Compromise_: Loading entire dataset into memory vs. database
   - _Why_: Rapid development, no database setup required, sufficient for 1,000 trials
   - _Trade-off_: Limited scalability but faster development and deployment

2. **Fuzzy Matching Algorithm**

   - _Compromise_: Simple text-based matching vs. advanced NLP/ML
   - _Why_: Time constraints, good enough for common disease variations
   - _Trade-off_: May miss complex medical terminology relationships

3. **Client-Side Filtering**

   - _Compromise_: Re-fetching data vs. client-side filtering after initial load
   - _Why_: Simpler implementation, better user experience for small dataset
   - _Trade-off_: Network overhead but more responsive filtering

4. **Single-File Component Architecture**
   - _Compromise_: Some larger components vs. extreme micro-components
   - _Why_: Balance between maintainability and over-engineering
   - _Trade-off_: Slightly larger files but easier to understand

### 3. User experience improvements and priorities

**Priority 1: Advanced Search Intelligence**

- Implement medical terminology synonyms (e.g., "cancer" ‚Üî "carcinoma")
- Add search suggestions and autocomplete
- Create saved searches and search history

**Priority 2: Enhanced Data Visualization**

- Add charts for trial distribution by phase, status, sponsor
- Geographic visualization of trial locations
- Timeline view of trial progression

**Priority 3: Comparative Analysis Tools**

- Side-by-side trial comparison
- Export functionality for competitive analysis
- Bookmark and note-taking features

**Priority 4: Performance Optimization**

- Implement virtual scrolling for large result sets
- Add progressive loading for trial details
- Optimize bundle size and loading times

**Priority 5: Mobile Experience**

- Improve mobile filtering experience
- Add swipe gestures for trial navigation
- Optimize table layout for small screens

## üåü Bonus Features Implemented

### 1. NSCLC Variations Handling ‚úÖ

- Comprehensive text normalization and fuzzy matching
- Handles common abbreviations and medical terminology
- Generates search variations automatically

### 2. Multi-condition Search ‚úÖ
